List of all files/directories copied from Kalpana:

- app/controllers/application_controller.rb (only snippets copied but needs to be monitored for changes)
- app/views/layouts/ (heavily modified, needs careful merging)
- app/views/organizations/ (modified, needs careful merging)
- config/assets.yml 
- config/initializers/simple_navigation.rb
- config/navigation.rb (modified)
- public/ (huge copy here, everything mostly identical for now but will diverge over time)
- Gemfile / Gemfile.lock (we don't use everything Kalpana does, but what we do needs to remain the same version)

Files copied from Candlepin:

- lib/candlepin_api.rb (should be kept identical until packaged as a library)
